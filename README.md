This project involves creating a recipe generator using embeddings and an LLM (Language Model). The goal is to generate cooking directions for recipes based on user-provided ingredients. 

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- sentence-transformers
- annoy
- google.generativeai (if used for LLM)
- IPython (for display and Markdown)

You can install these libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install pandas scikit-learn sentence-transformers annoy google-generativeai ipython
